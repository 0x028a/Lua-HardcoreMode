# Lua-HardcoreMode
Hardcore mode implementation in lua for cores running Eluna

This creates a simple hardcore mode implementation via a token/item in the players inventory.

This item is added by talking to an NPC with listed NPC ID.

Item and NPC are created with IDS 90000 but can be easily modified to work with your setup.
